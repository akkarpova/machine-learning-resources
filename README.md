# machine-learning-resources
A list of machine and deep learning resources, e.g. books, classes, courses, etc.

## Deep learning

### General
[http://www.deeplearningbook.org](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) - mathy approach.

[http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)

[Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) 

[http://course.fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai) - opposite approach of Ngâ€™s course.


### RNN/LSTM/GRU
[Introduction to RNNs - Tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/) - _(havent looked through the entire guide series, but looks good)_

[RNN Effectiveness](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

[Understanding LSTMs](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

_Try and find something about Sequence-to-Sequence models_

### CNN
[9 Deep Learning Papers You Need To Know About](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/The-9-Deep-Learning-Papers-You-Need-To-Know-About.html)

[CS231N course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu)

_Try to find something about inception networks

Try to find something about ResNet/DenseNet/Highway nets

Try to find something about YOLONet(9000)

Try to find something about CNN tracking networks_


### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
[Introduction to Generative Adversarial Netowrks (Tensorflow)](http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/)

[Introductory to GANs](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/introductory-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/) - A lot of approaches. Real math heavy area inspired by game theory. A lot of comparing different distance metrics, etc. 

### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
[Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-implementation/)
